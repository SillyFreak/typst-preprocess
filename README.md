# `typst-preprocess`

A tool for processing [prequery](https://typst.app/universe/package/prequery) data in Typst documents.

## TODOs

This is just a selection of soon-to-be-relevant things; almost nothing is currently working

- proper logging of job progress
- proper error types
- good configuration error handling with spans etc.
